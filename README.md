# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import Libraries – Load necessary Python libraries.
2.Load Dataset – Read the dataset containing study hours and marks.
3.Preprocess Data – Check for missing values and clean the data if needed.
4.Split Data – Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
5.Train Model – Fit a Simple Linear Regression model to the training data.
6.Make Predictions – Use the trained model to predict marks on the test data.
7.Evaluate Model – Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score.
8.Visualize Results – Plot the regression line along with actual data points 

## Program & Output:
```
